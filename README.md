I have created a note taker using express while also using the combined coding languages of Javascript HTML and CSS.  After I installed express I made sure that my server had acess to PORT 3000 in ordet to connect the front end of my webpage to the back end.  I made sure the CSS and Javascript pages were all linked and the right json packages were installed.  I was then able to reach the back end by clicking on Start and then I was able to write title notes and body notes while being able to save and delete them.
